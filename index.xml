Works of his I enjoy Revisionist History, possible the best history podcast ever The Tipping Point, a really good book that brought the idea of a tipping point for basically anything into the mainstream. Why I admire him He has done so much and so many amazing things in his life, he leads teams, writes books, and is one of the most productive poeple I am aware of.</description></item><item><title>Empathy assignment</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/school/9thLit/EmpathyAssignment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/school/9thLit/EmpathyAssignment/</guid><description>Empathy assignment Due: Aug 16th Article Notes Empathy is being able to emotionally understand what other people feel from their PoV &amp;ldquo;Putting yourself in someones shoes&amp;rdquo; People usually can understand the own feelings, but the feelings of others are hard to understand Some people are not empathetic, and respond with an opposite emotion from an interaction Signs of empathy Listening to others people tell u at their problems think abt how other people feel overwhelmed by tragic events help others in suffering feel drained in social situations caring Empathy can also be bad they can make u overwhelmed overstimulated burned out Types of empathy: Affective empathy: understand other emotions and respond the right way it may lead o feelings of personal distress Somatic empathy Physical reaction for example, second hand empathy Cognitive empathy being able to think of what others are thinking of &amp;ldquo;Theory of mind&amp;rdquo; Brainfacts Compassion &amp;amp; sympathy are not empathy, tho they are related Why?</description></item><item><title>French 3 H</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/school/French3H/thoughtsonclass/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/school/French3H/thoughtsonclass/</guid><description>My thoughts on French 3 H First impressions I may already speak french, but this seems really easy!

Viscosity: The speed at which something flows Polymer: Long molecule Hypothesis: Applying more shear force, as well as shaving creme, borax, baking soda, and contact solution to the slime during creation will lead to stronger links between molecules, making it better for slime useage.
Experiment: Take 2-3 oz of glue and mix with 1 teaspoon of contact solution.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/thoughts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/thoughts/</guid><description>Thoughts These are random thoughts and/or notes on basically anything.
Thoughts on the book I&amp;rsquo;m reading right now: Brain Facts Book , by brainfacts.org
What I&amp;rsquo;m learning: Psychology and neuroscience is my special interest right now!
Some links: Keyboards , or me trying to convince myself to spend $100 on a bunch of buttons Politics , a bunch of politics thoughts on government ability, and projects.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts - Keyboards</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/keyboards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/keyboards/</guid><description>Buying a keyboard Switches Based on my current research, tactile switches are the best bet for the most common type of typing I do. They provide nice feedback for typing when you aren&amp;rsquo;t looking, yet they wont be annoying for my family while I&amp;rsquo;m programming with them in the room. The most popular tactile switches are the Cherry MX Browns .
Form factor Based on some preliminary research, and a day of observing what I do on a keyboard, I have decided that a 65% keyboard would be best for me, as I need the arrow keys, but I do not use my numpad, except in certain edge-cases, in which cases I could just use my built-in numpad.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on BrainFacts</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/books/brainfacts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/books/brainfacts/</guid><description>BrainFacts, a primer on the brain and nervous system This will mostly be just notes at first, and maybe some reflection later
Basics I already knew this, but we don&amp;rsquo;t just use 10% of our brains! Fun facts. 1 in 4 people suffer a neurological or psychiatric condition.
There are 2 types of neurons, some excite others and try to make them fire, and some inhibit others from passing signals. The latter can be useful for separating different circuits and columns from crosstalk when that is bad.</description></item></channel></rss>
