# Buying a keyboard
## Switches
Based on my current research, tactile switches are the best bet for the most common type of typing I do. They provide nice feedback for typing when you aren't looking, yet they wont be annoying for my family while I'm programming with them in the room. The most popular tactile switches are the [Cherry MX Browns](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-brown.html).

## Form factor
Based on some preliminary research, and a day of observing what I do on a keyboard, I have decided that a 65% keyboard would be best for me, as I need the arrow keys, but I do not use my numpad, except in certain edge-cases, in which cases I could just use my built-in numpad.

## The actual keyboard
Given these aspects, and a lot of good reviews, the [Ducky One 2 SF](https://www.amazon.com/Ducky-Double-Mechanical-Keyboard-Cherry/dp/B08XC2B41D) seems to be my best bet when it comes to a nice, reasonably affordable, 65% keyboard. ~~(It's also very pretty)~~
