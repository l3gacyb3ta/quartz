Hello and welcome! I am Raleigh Wise, and welcome to my space here on this vast network of computers and people. I am currently based out of Georgia, going to school at Innovation Academy, a new STEM magnet school in Fulton County (with a very pretentious name).

I'm still not 100% sure what I want to do when I "grow up", but currently things that are fascinating to me include the intersection of tech and mental health, specifically ADHD and anxiety, as that's what I've been diagnosed with, and cybersecurity.

One thing you may immediately notice about me in person is that I am very strong willed when it comes to making the world a more fair and equal place for everyone, no matter what they believe or who they are. I am working on combating my internalized biases towards others, especially those I disagree with.

In the case that you anything here is interesting to you, I am always open to talking to new people! I'd love to work with new people on new things, or old people on old things.
