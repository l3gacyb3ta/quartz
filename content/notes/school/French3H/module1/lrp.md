## English into

Hello! My name is Raleigh Wise. I live in Roswell, GA right now, though I have lived all over, even across the pond! I am in 9th grade at the brand new STEM magnet school Innovation Academy right now. When I'm not at school I enjoy programming, singing, and doing crossfit. The reason I'm taking french is because I needed another honors class, and I already speak french very well, so I thought "Why not?".
