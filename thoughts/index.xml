Works of his I enjoy Revisionist History, possible the best history podcast ever The Tipping Point, a really good book that brought the idea of a tipping point for basically anything into the mainstream. Why I admire him He has done so much and so many amazing things in his life, he leads teams, writes books, and is one of the most productive poeple I am aware of.</description></item><item><title>Politics</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/politics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/politics/</guid><description>Politics Cool stuff governments can do: Black budget projects these are things that allow the government to hide money from public expenses.</description></item><item><title>Psychology and Neuroscience resources</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/psychologyneuroscience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/psychologyneuroscience/</guid><description>Psychology and Neuroscience resources MIT OpenCourseWare Intro to Psychology Brain Facts Book this is the book I&amp;rsquo;m reading now .

The most popular tactile switches are the Cherry MX Browns .
Form factor Based on some preliminary research, and a day of observing what I do on a keyboard, I have decided that a 65% keyboard would be best for me, as I need the arrow keys, but I do not use my numpad, except in certain edge-cases, in which cases I could just use my built-in numpad.</description></item><item><title>Thoughts on BrainFacts</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/books/brainfacts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/thoughts/books/brainfacts/</guid><description>BrainFacts, a primer on the brain and nervous system This will mostly be just notes at first, and maybe some reflection later

There are 2 types of neurons, some excite others and try to make them fire, and some inhibit others from passing signals. The latter can be useful for separating different circuits and columns from crosstalk when that is bad.</description></item></channel></rss>
